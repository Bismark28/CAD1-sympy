This is a git repo

Firs thing: 
* Create a github account

##IMPORTANT 
In each session I will ask you to create a new `.ipynb` file which you will continue work on. Therefore at the end of each session:
Add your material to your local repo and commit your changes by:
* adding :
```
	git add --all
```
	or 
```
	git add new_file.ipynb
```
* commit your changes : 
```
	git commit -am 'your message'

```
Every time for each session 
* fetch the repo from origin and rebase your local repo by following :
```
	git fetch origin 

```
```
	git rebase origin/master

```
